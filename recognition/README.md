# Recognition Track

In this sub-repo we shall progressively look at different ways in which we can tackle the problem of face-recognition with several different algorithms.

## Arcface

This is one of the most popular methods of performing the face recognition task today.

## Sub-center Arcface

This is an extension to arcface which helps in learning a better latent space than arcface for encoding facial representations because it takes into account the possibility of mislabelled images being present in each and every label/s.
